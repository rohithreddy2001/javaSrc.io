 in interface we can't define any method we can only declare.
 And abstract and void will be default no need to write again.
 when we work with interfaces we use implements like,
 we use extends in classes.
 We can create reference of an interface but can't create object 
 of interface.
 we can implement multiple inheritance using interface.
